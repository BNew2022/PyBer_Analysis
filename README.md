# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to aggregate the given data into 3 different types of cities, Rural, Urban and Suburban, and to glean insights into the number of drivers and average fares by each city type to figure out what kind of support and needs each different city type has.

## Results

As we can see by the results, Rural city type has the highest average fare, but the lowest number of fares and drivers.  This is primarily due to the fact that in rural areas, destinations are much more spread out, and there are less people per square kilometer.  Less people = less demand, longer distances to travel between destinations therefore higher fares.  We can see that the inverse is true for the Urban city type, since it is much more densely populated and trips are much shorter.  As to be expected, Suburban city type is in the middle of the two extremes.

## Summary

In order to ensure drivers are staying busy and earning a decent living, and customers are well served, we could look at reducing the number of drivers in rural areas slightly and re-distributing them to the busier city types, urban and suburban.  Also, looking at the seasonality data, we could look at redistributing drivers to busier city types during their peak seasons, thereby increasing the number of drivers available for peak times.
